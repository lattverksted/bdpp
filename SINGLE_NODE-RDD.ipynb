The films trailer seems to show an answer to this but it was edited out of the final cut A more serious problem is that unlike gremlins there is no clear reason for munchies to go from cute cuddly furballs to menacing monsters It just happens Further because Munchies was kept PG and the violence remains toned down when the creatures are in their monster phase theyre never very threatening Theyre also easily dispatched at least temporarilyAdmittedly the gist of the film isnt suspense horror compelling drama or any of that other stuff but humor Its intended more as a spoof of Gremlins and the countless rip-offs in its wake The only problem with that is that the film just isnt funny even though I chuckled a couple times A surprisingly high percentage of the jokes are bland clich√©s Too much of the remaining material consists of non-sequiturs Given bad timing from Hirsch it all just falls flat There was potential to make a film that while a spoof was both funny and frightening hilarious and disturbing cheesy and suspenseful all at the same time ala Killer Klowns from Outer Space (1988) Too bad then that Munchies comes nowhere near that', label='0')]"
